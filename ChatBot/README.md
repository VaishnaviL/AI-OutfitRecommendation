# BulletProof - A Fashion recommendation System

In our chatbot project, we leverage a powerful combination of tools and techniques to enhance its functionality. We begin by installing and importing essential libraries, such as LangChain, which plays a pivotal role in our PDF-based interactions. To access and manipulate PDFs seamlessly, we integrate LangChain's capabilities to load PDFs and perform chunking operations, making the information within these documents easily digestible.

One of the key innovations in our chatbot is the use of text embeddings. We utilize LangChain to embed text from various sources, allowing us to represent textual information in a numerical format. These embeddings are crucial for efficient data processing and retrieval.

To enhance the chatbot's conversational abilities, we create a retrieval function that utilizes these embeddings to search for and retrieve relevant information in response to user queries. This function is integral to providing accurate and context-aware responses.

Optionally, we implement chat memory to enhance the user experience. This feature allows our chatbot to maintain context throughout the conversation, providing a more personalized and engaging interaction for users. Together, these components form the foundation of our chatbot, delivering a seamless and intelligent conversational experience.
